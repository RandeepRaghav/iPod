# Coding-Ninjas-iPod-Mini-Project
**This is my project submission for the Coding Ninjas Web Developing course mini project which was a react app of iPod.** 

Which was Build an iPod using React.js. The following are the instructions:   Build a menu of options like you see such as Settings, Games, Music etc On clicking of the centre button go inside the menu Clicking on the menu should hide the menu and open a screen of that particular option, like settings, games etc Click and hold on the circular menu and move the mouse in a circular fashion inside the menu boundary (white circle is the menu) to navigate in the iPod menu Clicking on “Menu” should take you back to the main menu (Optionally) can create sub menu inside menu like in Music option, it has sub menu with options “All songs”, “Artists” etc.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
